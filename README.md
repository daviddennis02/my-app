# my-app -- About
A maven build app

This is a CI/CD project on AWS using AWS DevOps tools ðŸ§° :  AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy to build a java application using maven as build tool. The application is deployed using a specified deployment script.

## BuildSpec file

buildspec.yml file is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. I specify the buildspec.yml file in AWS CodeBuild in order to run the build, which results to a packaged artifact that can be deployed.
